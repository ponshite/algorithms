Suppose we implement Quicksort so that Choospivot always
selects the first element of the array. What is the running time
of this algorith on an input array that is already sorted?

O(n^2)


If we choose the median as pivot, the partitioning will be around the middle.
The recurrence will be the same as Merge Sort
T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)
T(n) = O(nlogn)
