Merge Sort Analysis.
Claim: For every input array of n numbers, Merge sort produces a sorted output
array and uses at most 6nlog2n +6 operations.

Proof of claim(assuming n = power of 2)
[will use "recursion tree"]


                      root O                                  level 0
                      O         O                             level 1
                     O O       O O                            level 2
                     ...       ...
                     ...       ...                            last level.

What is the level of the leaves?
log2n

How many work is done at each level?
At each level the input size is n/j^2

What is the number of subproblems in level j?
2^j

Total # operations at level j <= 2^j * 6(n/j^2) = 6n. Independent of the lvl j.
Two competing forces, the amount of work is halving while the number of
subproblems are growing.


Number of levels * work per level
(log2n + 1)* 6n = 6log2n + 6n
