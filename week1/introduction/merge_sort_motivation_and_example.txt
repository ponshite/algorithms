Why Study Merge Sort?!
It is a very ancient algorithm 1945.
Oldie but a goodie. Method of choice for sorting.
Good introduction to divide & conquer.
  Improves over selection, insertion and bubble sort.
Calibrate your preparation. Super high level idea.
Translating should be straightforward.
Motivates guiding principles for algorithm analysis (worst-case asymptotic analysis)
Analysis generalizes to "Master Method"


The sorting problem.
Input: array of n numbers, unsorted.
Output: same numbers, sorted in increasing order.


Merge Sort: Example.

          [5,4,1,8,7,2,6,3]

[5,4,1,8]               [7,2,6,3]
.                         .
.                         .
.                         .
[1,4,5,8]               [2,3,6,7]
            merge
        [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
