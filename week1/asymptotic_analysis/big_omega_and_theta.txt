Omega notation.
Mirrors Big Oh notation is its lower bounded.

T(n) = Omega(f(n)) if and only if there exists constants c,no such that
T(n) >= c*f(n) for all n>= no.

Theta Notation.
Definition:
T(n) = Theta(f(n)) if and only if T(n) = O(f(n)) and T(n) = Omega(f(n))

Equivalent, there exist constants  c1,c2,n0 such that
    c1f(n) <= T(n) <= c2f(n) for all n >= no.


We normally bother with upper bounds and not the lower bound.


Little - Oh Notation
Strictly less
Definition
T(n) = o(f(n)) if and only if all constants c>0, there exists a constant n0
such that
T(n) <= c f(n) for every n>=no
