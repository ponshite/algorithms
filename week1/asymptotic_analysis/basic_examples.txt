Example #1.
Claim: if T(n) akn^k + .... +a1n + a0

T(n) = O(n^k)

Proof:
Choose no=1 and c= |ak| + |ak-1| + .. |a1| + a|0|

Need to show that for every n>= n T(n) <= c * n^k

T(n) <= |ak|n^k + ... + |a1|n + |a0|
T(n) <= |ak|n^k + ... + |a1|n^k + |a0|n^k
T(n) <= c *n^k
QED

Claim: For every k>=1, n^k is not O(n^k-1)
Proof: By Contradiction.

Suppose n^k is indeed O(n^k-1)
then there will be two constants c,n0 >0 such that
n^k <= c * n^k-1
But then
n<=c which is clearly false.
